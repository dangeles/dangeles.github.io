Welcome! I am scientist interested in genetics, genomics and microbiomics.
I enjoy using quantitative methods to extract as much information
as possible from an experiment. I obtained my Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and
Molecular Biophysics](http://www.cce.caltech.edu/content/biochemistry-and-molecular-biophysics)
at the California Institute of Technology, where I did my graduate work with
[Paul Sternberg](http://wormlab.caltech.edu/LabMembers/Paul) figuring out how to
use transcriptomes as phenotypes for genetic analysis in *C. elegans*. Next,
I did a brief postdoc with [Eric Alm](https://web.mit.edu/almlab/ealm.html) at
MIT on the gut microbiome before transitioning into the Computational Biology
unit at [eGenesis](https://www.egenesisbio.com/).
