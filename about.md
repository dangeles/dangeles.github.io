Welcome! I am a computational biologist specializing in genomics, transcription
and regulatory network reconstruction. I enjoy using quantitative methods to
extract as much information as possible from every single experiment. I obtained
my Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](http://www.cce.caltech.edu/content/biochemistry-and-molecular-biophysics)
at the California Institute of Technology, where I did my graduate work with
[Paul Sternberg](http://wormlab.caltech.edu/LabMembers/Paul) figuring out how to
use transcriptomes as phenotypes for genetic analysis in *C. elegans*. Next,
I did a brief postdoc with Eric Alm at
MIT on the gut microbiome. I am currently a scientist in [Altos Labs](https://altoslabs.com/), where I work with [Hana El-Samad](https://altoslabs.com/team/principal-investigators-bay-area/hana-el-samad/). I also have a standing appointment as a visiting scholar in Northwestern University, where I collaborate with Ilya Ruvinsky.
