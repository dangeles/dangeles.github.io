Welcome! I am a computational biologist specializing in genomics, transcription
and regulatory network reconstruction. I enjoy using quantitative methods to
extract as much information as possible from every single experiment. I obtained
my Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](http://www.cce.caltech.edu/content/biochemistry-and-molecular-biophysics)
at the California Institute of Technology, where I did my graduate work with
[Paul Sternberg](http://wormlab.caltech.edu/LabMembers/Paul) figuring out how to
use transcriptomes as phenotypes for genetic analysis in *C. elegans*. Next,
I did a brief postdoc with [Eric Alm](https://web.mit.edu/almlab/ealm.html) at
MIT on the gut microbiome. I am currently in the biotech world, but I have
an appointment as visiting scholar at Northwestern University (2019-2020).
