Welcome! I am scientist interested in genetics, genomics and (most recently)
microbiomics. I enjoy using quantitative methods to extract as much information
as possible from an experiment. In the past, I have worked extensively with
bulk RNA-seq datasets. I obtained my Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](http://www.cce.caltech.edu/content/biochemistry-and-molecular-biophysics)
at the California Institute of Technology, where I did my graduate work with
[Paul Sternberg](http://wormlab.caltech.edu/LabMembers/Paul) figuring out how to
use transcriptomes as phenotypes for genetic analysis in *C. elegans*.
