Hi! I am a computational biologist specializing in applying artificial intelligence methods to biological data, with a special emphasis on transcriptomics. I obtained
my Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.cce.caltech.edu/graduate/graduate-biochemistry-and-molecular-biophysics)
at the California Institute of Technology, where I did my graduate work with
[Paul Sternberg](http://wormlab.caltech.edu/LabMembers/Paul) developing statistical methods to enable the use of transcriptomes as phenotypes for genetic analysis. 
I did a brief postdoc with Eric Alm at MIT on the gut microbiome. I am currently a Sr. Computational Scientist in [Altos Labs](https://altoslabs.com/) at the Bay
Area Institute of Science. I am also a visiting scholar at Northwestern University, where I collaborate with Ilya Ruvinsky.
