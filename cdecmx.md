### What is [*Clubes de Ciencia (CdeC)*](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/)

Clubes de Ciencia, or Science Clubs, is an educational initiative led entirely
by graduate students. It's very simple-once a year, graduate students from around
the world are paired with a graduate student based in Mexico to teach a week-long
intensive workshop on a scientific subject of their choosing. What started out
as a small number of Mexican graduate students trying to teach science in our
home country has rapidly grown into a major initiative that offers almost 50
workshops in 5+ cities in Mexico. Additionally, graduate students from other
Latin American countries have adopted this model, and as a result *Clubes* is
rapidly expanding into other countries, including Colombia and Peru.
