### What is [*Clubes de Ciencia (CdeC)*](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/)?

*Clubes de Ciencia*, or Science Clubs, is an educational initiative led entirely
by graduate students. It's very simple-once a year, graduate students from around
the world are paired with a graduate student based in Mexico to teach a week-long
intensive workshop on a scientific subject of their choosing. What started out
as a small number of Mexican graduate students trying to teach science in our
home country has rapidly grown into a major initiative that offers almost 50
workshops in 5+ cities in Mexico. Additionally, graduate students from other
Latin American countries have adopted this model, and as a result *Clubes* is
rapidly expanding into other countries, including Colombia and Peru.

Even though Caltech is small, I am happy to say that the community has rallied
and we are active participants, contributors and planners with *Clubes*. Below
are some of the activities that I've had the pleasure of participating in. I
would like to share these experiences and ideas with you in the hopes that maybe
one day you will also apply!

### Foldscopes come to *Clubes*
Last year at ASCB 2016, I ambushed Manu Prakash and told him all about Clubes.
He loved the idea, and together with Maxwell Coyle and Honomi Ijima we schemed
a plan to get Foldscopes to Clubes. Earlier this year, the team sent us more
than 100 Foldscopes and provided training for 5 instructors who will be giving
workshops this year! I'm looking forward to hearing what the students have to
say about this (I will update this after the workshops happen). Thanks Manu,
Max, Honomi and the rest of the Foldscope community for this great opportunity!

### Discovering a new planarian species in Guanajuato
In 2016, I led a *Clubes de Ciencia* workshop in Guanajuato with HHMI Investigator
Alejandro Sánchez-Alvarado. We talked genetics in *C. elegans* and planarians.
When Alejandro showed up, he brought with him a number of planarians for the
students to cut up into tiny little pieces, which the students did in short
order. See below!
