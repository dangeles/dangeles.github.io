## What is [*Clubes de Ciencia (CdeC)*](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/)?

*Clubes de Ciencia*, or Science Clubs, is an educational initiative led entirely
by graduate students. It's very simple-once a year, graduate students from around
the world are paired with a graduate student based in Mexico to teach a week-long
intensive workshop on a scientific subject of their choosing. What started out
as a small number of Mexican graduate students trying to teach science in our
home country has rapidly grown into a major initiative that offers almost 50
workshops in 5+ cities in Mexico. Additionally, graduate students from other
Latin American countries have adopted this model, and as a result *Clubes* is
rapidly expanding into other countries, including Colombia and Peru.

Even though Caltech is small, I am happy to say that the community has rallied
and we are active participants, contributors and planners with *Clubes*. Below
are some of the activities that I've had the pleasure of participating in. I
would like to share these experiences and ideas with you in the hopes that maybe
one day you will also apply!

## Foldscopes come to *Clubes*
Last year at ASCB 2016, I ambushed
[Manu Prakash](http://web.stanford.edu/group/prakash-lab), inventor of the
[Foldscope](https://www.foldscope.com), and told him all about *Clubes*. He loved
the idea, and together with
[Maxwell Coyle and Honomi Ijima](https://www.foldscope.com/team/) we schemed
a plan to bring Foldscopes to Clubes. Earlier this year, the team sent us more
than 100 Foldscopes and provided training for 5 instructors who will be giving
workshops this year! I'm looking forward to hearing what the students have to
say about this (I will update this after the workshops happen). Thanks Manu,
Max, Honomi and the rest of the Foldscope community for this great opportunity!

## Discovering a new planarian species in Guanajuato
In 2016, I led a *Clubes de Ciencia* workshop in Guanajuato along with HHMI
Investigator
[Alejandro Sánchez-Alvarado](http://www.hhmi.org/scientists/alejandro-sanchez-alvarado).
We talked about genetics in *C. elegans* and planarians. When Alejandro showed
up, he brought with him a number of planarians for the students to cut up into
tiny little pieces, which the students did in short order. See below!

One of the things Alejandro told me he was interested in doing was searching for
undiscovered planarian species with our students. We asked the students to point
us to places where there was good hiking and plenty of clean running water.
Fernando, one of our students, mentioned a dam that had some amenable hiking.
So, the following day the class set out to the dam. When we arrived, we hiked
for no more than 20 minutes before we were (quite literally) swimming in
planarians!!!!

After the fact, we took the planarians back to the lab, where we studied their
morphology, movement, and regenerative abilities. After the course ended,
Alejandro took a small number of planarians back to his laboratory for further
study. Months later, he confirmed our suspicions: This species has never been
previously described! Thanks to his lab, we now have a genome and a transcriptome.
Hopefully, at some point Alejandro and his team will get around to writing a paper
about this beautiful animal, known henceforth as *Dugesia guanajuatensis*.

## Embryology, Woods Hole-style, in Baja California, México

*Clubes* offers two consecutive weeks of workshops. Initially, I was scheduled
to give a *Club* in Guanajuato (see above) and Heather, my partner, was scheduled
to give a *Club* the week before in Ensenada. However, Heather's instructor had
to cancel last-minute. Since
[Caltech is driving distance from Ensenada](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/California+Institute+of+Technology,+1200+East+California+Boulevard,+Pasadena,+CA+91125,+USA/Ensenada/@33.0065568,-118.5306754,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c2c4a7ea997b91:0x3499e7d01a61dd1a!2m2!1d-118.125269!2d34.1376576!1m5!1m1!1s0x80d88ef01f54b9f5:0xf360981bb676a651!2m2!1d-116.5963713!2d31.8667427),
we decided I might as well come along and be her co-instructor for the week as
well. Heather had planned an amazing workshop based on animal development, and
so we drove into the sunset (ok, not quite) into Mexico.

Once in Ensenada, Heather deployed an amazing Embryology course that strongly
reminded me of a
[certain famous course](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/embryology/).
Our first step was to show students how to extract DNA

DNA extraction time!

Heather had brought a number of embryos from different species with her to Mexico.
After the students made their own makeshift microscopes, which Heather had designed,
we introduced them to various embryos, including *Xenopus* gastrulating embryos,
*Aurelia* polyps, sea urchins and *Drosophila* embryos. They had a chance to image
these animals using both their newly made microscopes or some stereomicroscopes
that the University hosting us had kindly provided.
