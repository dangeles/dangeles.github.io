# A bit about me

Hi! I'm a computational biologist and AI/ML consultant with a passion for translating complex biological data into actionable insights. With a unique blend of expertise in both wet-lab methodologies and quantitative analysis, I specialize in bridging the gap between experimental biology and computational modeling.

My unique strength lies in my ability to convey complex computational concepts in simple terms while deeply understanding the biological and computational foundations of a scientific research project. My goal as a member of your scientific team will always be
to propose concrete, testable hypotheses as a result of quantitative data analyses arising from ML/AI; and to develop powerful
experimental frameworks capable of generating training data for AI/ML models that maximizes their probability of generating useful
answers.

I'm particularly passionate about understanding gene regulation, transcriptome dynamics, and the integration of machine learning with biological data to drive innovation in healthcare and biotechnology. I have worked on a fairly wide variety of projects, and I
particularly enjoy learning and mastering new fields.

### Professional Background

I hold a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics from **Caltech**, following a B.A. in Molecular and Cellular Biology from **Cornell University**. I was also a postdoctoral fellow at **MIT** in the department of bioengineering, where I published several peer-reviewed articles.

Throughout my career, I've held pivotal roles at:

- **eGenesis**: Established the computational biology core and performed critical computational studies that enabled the first compassionate use transplantation of a pig kidney into a human patient by stabilizing gene expression levels of immunosuppressive payload genes through the design of pan-tissue, low burstiness promoters.
- **Altos Labs**: As one of the first hires at this prestigious unicorn startup, I was a key driver and developer of multiple AI/ML initiatives. I led both wet-lab and computational investigations into partial reprogramming translational programs. Additionally, I organized the company's inaugural symposium, developing a matchmaking algorithm to optimize workshop assignments for over 500 participants.

Currently, I'm working at a small startup and run my own consulting LLC, offering services in AI/ML and computational biology.

### My Expertise

- **Computational Biology & AI/ML**:
  - Perturbational biology (Perturb-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq)
  - Development of inferential algorithms and dimensionality reduction methods
  - Python programming, mathematical biology, and statistical mechanics
  - Experience with whole genome sequencing and NGS core facility setup

- **Molecular Genetics**:
  - Trained in experimental genetics and molecular biology
  - I completed the prestigious Embryology course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA
  - I have experience working with a range of organisms, including pigs, macaques, nematodes, and bacteria
  - My unique background gives me unique insight into multi-scale and translational issues in biology, understanding how *in vitro* cell culture models relate to *in vivo* systems

- **Interdisciplinary Team Building**:
  - Proven ability to assemble and lead cross-functional teams
  - Skilled at facilitating communication between computational and biological scientists

### Personal Interests

Outside of work, I'm an avid scuba diver, hiker, and traveler. I dedicate time to mentoring graduate students, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, to foster diversity in the scientific community.
