title: First ever Snowhike!

I completed my first-ever snowhike on December 20th, 2020 with my friend Katya
Moniz. She gave me a pair of (enormous) snow-shoes I could use, and we hiked up
Mt. Percival. We had intended to do the Mt. Percival-Mt. Morgan loop, but we
arrived a bit later than we had intended, so instead of completing the loop, we
simply doubled back after we summitted Mt. Percival.

Incidentally, this was also Zorro's first snow-hike. He *really* enjoyed it!

On January 9th, I went back, and completed the loop in what was my first solo
hike of 2021. It was so much fun!
