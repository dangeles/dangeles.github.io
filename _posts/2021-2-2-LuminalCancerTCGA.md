title: Classification and analysis of TCGA Luminal Cancer datasets
categories: rna-seq NGS programming science
---

Here, I analyze the TCGA datasets available for 311 patients with breast cancer
classified as subtype *luminal A* or *luminal B*. These two cancers are quite
difficult to distinguish by histological analysis, and the main distinguishing
characteristic appears to be that *luminal B* grows slightly faster and has a
slightly worse prognosis than *luminal A* cancer.
