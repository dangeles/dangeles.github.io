title: What does it mean to socially distance PART 2
categories: epidemiology pandemic
author: David
description: In this post, I set out to study at the heterogeneity in COVID infections across states in the USA. We will discover that there is lots of heterogeneity among states.

One of the things that bothered me about the previous post was that it did not
address the enormous heterogeneity that has characterized this pandemic. So,
in this second notebook, I quickly try to address some of those hetergeneous
elements. And guess what? The differences between states are enormous. I would
love to know what the pandemic looks like on a county-by-county level, but I
suspect that is far too terrifying to look at right now.

Bottom line:

**Be aware of what communities you inhabit. Different communities, different safety profiles. Be proactively safe!**
