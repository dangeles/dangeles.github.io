# SARS-Cov2 by the numbers

This virus is interesting to think about. Here are some numbers we can immediately derive 'from first principles'. Please note, as with all my posts, I don't guarantee accuracy and these 'guesstimates' should be considered rough and unpolished and probably accurate to within 1-2 (in some cases 3) **orders of magnitude**. That's OK-they should be enough to give us a sense of what it means to be a virus. I encourage everyone
to carry out these back of the envelope calculations themselves--it's an
enlightening exercise for me, and the results never cease to amaze me.

## Mass of the virus
Well, 1 H atom weighs ~$10^{-24}$ g. The virus
can't weigh less than 1000 H atoms, and it definitely can't
weigh more than 1ng=$10^{-9}$ g. If we take the geometric
mean of these upper and lower bounds, we get **a weight of
~$10^{-15}$ g or 1 billion Daltons per virion**.

## Total virions in an infected individual:
In an average adult, there are $10^{13}$ cells. A COVID positive
individual cannot possibly have less than $10^6$ virions, and it
seems unlikely that a virus could make more than 10,000 virions per
cell lysed. Therefore, the absolute maximum number of virions a
COVID infected individual could produce if all of their cells were
infected and lysed is ~$10^{16}$ virions.

Once again, the geometric mean approximation suggests **an
infected individual may create $10^{11}$ virions in their body.**

Is this number reasonable? A previous publication put the
total number of viruses in the world at $10^{31}$. If all
humans were infected with SARS-Cov2, our upper bound estimate
for total virion particles would be $10^{16} * 10^{10} =
10^{26}$. Even if all humans were to infect all cells in all
human beings on the planet and lyse them to create 1,000
virion progeny, the resulting virions would barely account
for 0.001% of all viruses on Earth.

## Total viral mass if SARS-Cov2 infected all humans on the planet
This number is easy: If the virus weighs $10^{-15}$ g / virion
and there are $10^{10}$ human beings on the planet and each
human contains $10^{11}$ virions, then there will be
$10^{21}$ virion particles once SARS-Cov2 colonizes the
planet entirely, and the resulting viral mass will be
1,000kg. In other words, **the total viral mass required for
a virus of this size to take over the planet is the
equivalent of a bear!**

## Volume of the virus
1 H atom has a diameter ~ 0.1nm. Since we agreed the virus weighs
$10^{-15}$ g this is equivalent to about 100 million H atoms. Therefore,
the total volume must be at least 100 million times greater than a
single H atom. The volume of one atom is ~ $10^{-3}$ nm $^3$. That means
the virus has a volume of at least $10^5$ nm $^3$ =
$10^5 * 10^{-24} = 10^{-19}$ L = $10^{-4}$ fL. Of course, this assumes
optimal packing, which will definitely not be the case--add an extra
order of magnitude for that reason. So, it's likely the virus measures
0.001fL in volume.

Therefore, it the virus colonizes humanity completely, the total viral
volume will be $10^{18}$ fL = 1,000L.

# Conclusion
A single infection creates .1uL of virus -- an amount so small it
would fit in a (\*gasp\*) 20uL pipette tip and be barely visible -- that
weighs 0.1mg. If it infected all of humanity, that virus could be
packaged into the approximate volume of a bear. One bear, taking over all
of humanity. That is what is happening.
