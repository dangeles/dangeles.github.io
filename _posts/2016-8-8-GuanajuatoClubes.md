One week after we visited Ensenada, Heather and I flew to Guanajuato to teach
our second development course. There, we met up with Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado
who would give the students the wonderful opportunity to teach the planarian
section. I have written about the course experience quite extensively
(here)[https://dangeles.github.io/cdc], so I won't go into full details here.
Suffice to say that the experience was wonderful.

Rather, I want to reflect just for a moment on the spectacular beauty of this
colonial city. The name `Quanaxhuato` means 'frog hill' in the Tarasca language.
These frogs have largely disappeared since Mesoamerican times because of the
damage done to the environment. This wonderful city is northwest of Mexico City,
my original home. It was established by the Spanish in the early 1500's after
they discovered gold in the state. Around this time, there was a significant
indigenous population living here, but unlike other populations the Spanish
could not subjugate them into slavery. The terrain here was tricky and hard to
navigate. The native populations, with their superior knowledge of the terrain
could simply move to inaccessible areas far from Spanish influence. As a result,
the Spanish were forced to bring in African slaves to work in the mines.

Guanajuato was at the center of the Mexican Independence war. The historic battle
of the *Alhóndiga de Granaditas* was fought early in the war, when Mexican
insurgents surrounded the city's granary, within which the Spanish and Criollo
populations took cover. Eventually the *Alhóndiga* was captured at great cost
to the insurgents, and many of the Spanish and Criollos who were captured inside
were killed. The city would be fought over throughout the rest of the war, until
its permanent annexation into the newly formed Mexican republic in 1821.

Beyond its historical significance, Guanajuato is a culturally wealthy city,
comparable (in my humble opinion) to great metropolitan cities like Paris. This
beautiful, multicolor city is built into the hills around it, and tunnels
engineered with great precision provide excellent transit throughout. As a
result of the hilly topology, the streets are quite narrow and are called
*callejones*. The *Alhóndiga* (now a museum) crowns the city center. Testament
to its cultural heritage, Guanajuato is the city with the greatest number of
theaters in the country. Each year, there is an enormous festival called the
*Cervantino*. During this festival, the city swells with visitors and hosts
a myriad operas, theater productions and conferences in honor of *Miguel de
Cervantes*, author of *Don Quijote de la Mancha*. The first festival was
celebrated in 1972 and has happened yearly since, becoming a major attraction
and a significant source of income for the city and the state. I still do not
fully understand how the city's infatuation with *Cervantes* began.

The visit was nothing short of magical. I think I may have forgotten a bit of
my heart there.
