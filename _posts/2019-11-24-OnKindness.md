On September 12, 2019, I lost everything.
In the aftermath of a brutal assault, I found
myself alone, with no money, severely injured
in a strange city. The most I could manage
was to sit in the curb of a lonely street,
with the Sun burning the nape of my neck,
wondering,

*How did I end up like this?*

Either before or after I was robbed, I
received news that I would never see a loved
one again. Maybe that is why I did not listen
to my gut, as the hair on the back of my neck
bristled. Maybe that is why I shook away the
feeling that I was walking into a trap. Maybe.
I simply cannot remember all the details or
the order of events.

What I can remember is that as I stumbled on
to the curb, my phone rang. A friend, Colin,
called me because he was with another college
buddy of ours Sean and they wanted to
reminisce. When they found out what had
transpired, the two of them organized to
airlift me somewhere I could get the
attention I badly needed. As I left the
ground, I had trouble gathering my thoughts,
but a single idea resonated powerfully
throughout my body:

*Nothing matters any more.*

The wounds have not healed easily. After all,
my life did vaporize in front of me. Beyond
everything else, I my spirit felt broken
by unbearable pain. It's hard to begin to
heal when you can't feel hope.

The days since then have been, simultaneously,
the hardest and the most inspiring I have
lived through. Inspiring, because as news of
my situation have spread, I have realized how
wrong I was to believe my life was ended. In
the moments when I thought everything was in
free-fall, I felt myself being lifted by a
thousand helpings hands. I have discovered I
have far more friends than I had any right to
expect.

Being vulnerable is a strange thing. When you
are strong, it's easy to forget how many
small good actions we witness in a given day.
As strength fades, it becomes easier to notice
these tiny flowers. Throughout these past
days, I have received the tremendous gift of a
million tiny drops of kindness that people
have bestowed upon me one instant at a time.
Individually, each drop is meaningless. But
the beauty of our world is that these
individual acts of kindness, which cost
nothing to give, can and do combine over
time to generate lakes, rivers and even to
carve canyons.

On September 12, 2019, my life as I knew it
ended in fire. However, the kindness of my
friends and family have given me a chance to
rebuild, to regenerate a new life and to
forget and forgive the cruelties of life,
taking them as lessons upon which to build
a life filled with mercy and love. The days
are still hard, and there is much pain ahead,
but I will grow through it.

For your kindness, you have my infinite
gratitude.
