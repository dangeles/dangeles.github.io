I wrote a short tutorial on NMF. Initially, I was skeptical about NMF, but I
ended up learning a lot about it, and I discovered that the implementation makes
use of an EM approach to efficiently compute the factorization. I had a lot of
fun writing this tutorial-hopefully it's useful to someone out there as well!
