description: A rolling analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, updated routinely.

Here's a rolling analysis that I will keep up-to-date and refreshed throughout
the academic. The analysis relies on data from the NYT to track the pandemic
throughout the United States. Please note that *I am not an epidemiologist, and
I do not guarantee the accuracy of any of these results*. Please also note that
these analyses should NOT be used to draw firm conclusions. For that, I defer to
Trevor Bedford, Carl Bergstrom or the Nextstrain team.

PD: Updates have been terminated because the pandemicis now under control.
