In July, Heather and I headed down to Ensenada to teach a Clubes workshop.
Originally I wasn't supposed to go with her, but her co-instructor cancelled at
the last minute. Ensenada is quite close to LA&mdash;barely a 4 hour drive!

Heather had prepared a developmental biology workshop, complete with DIY
microscopes. We may have smuggled some embryos across the border as well (they
  were disposed of properly).

Once in Ensenada, Heather started off the course teaching the students how to
perform DNA extractions. The students loved it! She taught them about Hox genes
and their role in fly development. I gave the students a basic introduction to
*C.&nbsp;elegans* development and then we took them to the tidepools to look for
small critters. We found plenty, including a gorgeous barnacle, many polychaetes
and a gorgeous marine flatworm!

Ensenada is such a gorgeous city, filled with amazing food and with truly
spectacular universities. We were lucky they were willing to host us for a week
to teach science. The students were also wonderful&mdash;full of energy and
questions, ready to start experimenting at the first opportunity.
