title: COVID-19: What does it mean to socially distance?
categories: epidemiology pandemic

I am SO tired of socially distancing. I want to hang out with 1 or 2 different
people every day. That's not a lot, right?! I am being reasonable if I do that.
Right?

In this blog post, I go through some elementary math to show just how essential
it is that we resist the instinct to hang out with 1 or 2 different people each
day.

Note: The calculations in this notebook are heavily idealized, and in particular
they do not take into account local variations in rate or in the amount of
'hanging out' time.

I hope this is helpful!
