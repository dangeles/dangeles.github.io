title: What does it mean to socially distance
categories: epidemiology pandemic
author: David
description: In this post, I work through the math to figure out exactly how important it is for us to be strict about social distancing. There's been a lot said about the community benefits of distancing, but I wanted to take a look at social distancing from the perspective of an individual, not a society.

I am SO tired of socially distancing. I want to hang out with 1 or 2 different
people every day. That's not a lot, right?! I am being reasonable if I do that.
Right?

In this blog post, I go through some elementary math to show just how essential
it is that we resist the instinct to hang out with 1 or 2 different people each
day.

Note: The calculations in this notebook are heavily idealized, and in particular
they do not take into account local variations in rate or in the amount of
'hanging out' time.

I hope this is helpful!
